A web application for managing investment portfolios and tracking trades. Built with **Spring Boot** (backend), **React** (frontend), and containerized using **Docker**. Users can manage funds, log trades with details (date, position, EUR/PLN exchange rate), and calculate profits based on real-time fund prices fetched via REST APIs.
